A Twist on a Classic Game

Hello my name is Caleb.

I am a student from the 2015 graduating class from the Academy of Aerospace and Engineering high-school in Hartford. In my senior year I took AP Computer Science and also took the AP test. I earned a three on the test and am proud of what I've been able to accomplish. In the second half of the year in the class I took an interest in the Python language and have been programming in the language ever since. 

The project/game I created was for my AP Computer Science Final, which I'm very happy to say was a success and a learning experience. Screen capture of game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvXrSifDCc0

Please feel free to modify or add onto the project/game as you want, just be sure to give credit to me. Be on the look out for my next project which will be another interesting game.

** To access the project/game look for a download zip button on this site (should be on right hand side if on desktop version of this site) and click it. Once downloaded, unzip the zip file and open the unzipped folder. When in the folder look for a text file called README PLEASE and read it. You should be all set to go after that. Have fun! **

** Quick note - MAC USERS: If you are on Mac and want to test you will need Python 3 or higher and Pygame installed - How-To -> https://youtu.be/c_TzqzKZpMw. Once done, unzip folder, open folder, look for a folder named files and open it. Inside that folder double click file named Main_Spaceshooter.py to start game. 

Also if your computer is warning you about opening the file its because its blocking it. To get past this right click the whole project folder and hover over the send to menu option and select send to compressed zip folder. This will make your computer believe that you are the creator of the folder and it will treat as not a foreign object. Then proceed with the steps above to get to the game. **

My second game is named defensive particle pong. The objective in the game is to score five points. But scoring those points is not the easiest task. Each player is equipped with a pack of weapons to destroy the other player, wiping the possibility of winning away. Each player is granted a shield, missiles, (and some other weapon I havenâ€™t thought of yet).

Still in the works but will post on Github when in alpha and beta. 

Thanks, 


Caleb.
